# New {IA Name} Fathead
Help DuckDuckGo become the best Search Engine for {Language} developers!


### What do I need to know?
Fathead developers need to know how to code in **Python**, **Ruby**, **Perl**, or **JavaScript**. 


### What am I doing?
Write a script that scrapes or downloads the {Name of Documentation Source} docs, parses it, and generates an **output.txt** file containing the parsed documentation.

You can learn more about Fathead Instant Answers, and the `output.txt` syntax [**here**](https://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/fathead-overview.html)!


### The data source :rocket:
{URL to Data Source}


## The Goal
Help *improve {Language Name} language search results* on DuckDuckGo as part of our Programming Mission! We're trying to reach 100% Instant Answer (IA) coverage for {Language Name}-related searches by creating new Instant Answers, and improving existing ones.
