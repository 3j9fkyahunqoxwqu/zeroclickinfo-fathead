# New {IA Name} Fathead
Help DuckDuckGo become the best Search Engine for {Language} developers!


### What is the Goal?
As part of our Programming Mission, we're aiming to reach 100% Instant Answer (IA) coverage for {Language Name}-related searches by creating new Instant Answers, and improving existing ones.


### What do I need to know?
You'll need to know how to code in **Python**, **Ruby**, **Perl**, or **JavaScript**.


### What am I doing?
You will write a script that scrapes or downloads the {Name of Documentation Source} docs, and generates an **output.txt** file containing the parsed documentation.

You can learn more about Fathead Instant Answers, and the `output.txt` syntax [**here**](https://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/fathead-overview.html)!
