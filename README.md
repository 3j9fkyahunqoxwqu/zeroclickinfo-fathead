# Welcome to DuckDuckHack!

We're a community dedicated to improving search results with open source, "Instant Answers", that solve searches in few or zero clicks.


## What are Fathead Instant Answers?
A set of key-value pairs, stored in a database. Fatheads provide unique answers (values) to a specific set of queries (keys). The key-value pairs are generated by parsing static data sources, such as technical documentation.

#### Examples

- Ruby Docs Fathead
    - [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/tree/master/lib/fathead/ruby) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=array+bsearch&ia=about) | [Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/view/ruby)
- CSS Fathead
    - [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/tree/master/lib/fathead/mdn_css) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+background-position&ia=about) | [Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/view/mdn_css)

**Here's how it looks!**
