# Welcome to DuckDuckHack!

We're a community dedicated to improving search results with open source, "Instant Answers", that solve searches in few or zero clicks.


### The Programming Mission
The current focus of DuckDuckHack is to create the best search engine for programmers. For now, we are **only accepting Pull Requests and Issues related to the Programming Mission**.


## Get Started
Your help and expertise can have a huge impact on improving the search experience for millions of DuckDuckGo users around the world!

The quickest way to get started, is to [**create new Fatheads, and improve existing ones**](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"Mission%3A+Programming").


### What are Fathead Instant Answers?
A set of key-value pairs, stored in a database. Fatheads provide unique answers (values) to a specific set of queries (keys). The key-value pairs are generated by parsing static data sources, such as technical documentation.

#### Example

- CSS Fathead
    - [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/tree/master/lib/fathead/mdn_css) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+background-position&ia=about) | [Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/view/mdn_css)

**Here's how it looks!**
