:right	A										The :right CSS page pseudo-class matches any right page when printing a page. It allows to describe the styling of right-side page.
mask-composite	A										The mask-composite CSS property represents a compositing operation used on the current mask layer with the mask layers below it.
Shorthand properties	A										Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of several other CSS properties simultaneously. Using a shorthand property, a Web developer can write more concise and often more readable style sheets, saving time and energy.
filter	A										The filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.
fallback	A										The fallback descriptor can be used to specify a counter style to fall back to if the current counter style cannot create a marker representation for a particular counter value.
::spelling-error	A										The ::spelling-error CSS pseudo-element represents a text segment which the browser has flagged as incorrectly spelled.
<angle>	A										The angle CSS data type represents angle values. Positive angles represent clockwise angles, negative angles represent counterclockwise angles. Its syntax is a number data type immediately followed by the unit (deg, grad, rad or turn). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
column-fill	A										The column-fill CSS property controls how contents are partitioned into columns. Contents are either balanced, which means that contents in all columns will have the same height or, when using auto, just take up the room the content needs.
min-block-size	A										The min-block-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical minimal size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the min-width or the min-height property, depending on the value defined for writing-mode. If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of min-block-size relates to the minimal width of the element, otherwise it relates to the minimal height of the element. It relates to min-inline-size, which defines the other dimension of the element.
border-bottom-color	A										The border-bottom-color CSS property sets the color of the bottom border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-bottom are more convenient and preferable.
transition-property	A										The transition-property CSS property is used to specify the names of CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied.
scroll-snap-coordinate	A										The scroll-snap-coordinate CSS property defines the positions in x and y coordinates within the element which will align with the nearest ancestor scroll container's scroll-snap-destination for the respective axis.
<resolution>	A										The resolution CSS data types, used in media queries, denotes the density of pixels of an output device, its resolution. It is a number immediately followed by a unit of resolution (dpi, dpcm,...). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
::after (:after)	A										The CSS ::after pseudo-element matches a virtual last child of the selected element. It is typically used to add cosmetic content to an element by using the content CSS property. This element is inline by default.
<url>	A										The url CSS data type denotes a pointer to a resource. It has no proper syntax and can only be expressed through the url() functional notation.
<string>	A										The string CSS data type represents a string. It is formed by a Unicode characters delimited by either double (") or single (') quotes. A double quoted string cannot contain double quotes unless escaped using a backslash (\). The same practice applies for single quoted strings, they cannot contain single quotes unless escaped using a backslash (\). The backslash character must be escaped to be part of the string.
text-combine-upright	A										The text-combine-upright CSS property specifies the combination of multiple characters into the space of a single character. If the combined text is wider than 1em, the user agent must fit the contents within 1em. The resulting composition is treated as a single upright glyph for layout and decoration. This property only has an effect in vertical writing modes.
margin-block-start	A										The margin-block-start CSS property defines the logical block start margin of an element, which maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, or margin-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
Type selectors	A										CSS type selectors match elements by node name. Used alone, therefore, a type selector for a particular node name selects all elements of that type — that is, with that node name — in the document.
padding-inline-start	A										The padding-inline-start CSS property defines the logical inline start padding of an element, which maps to a physical padding depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, or padding-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
font-size	A										The font-size CSS property specifies the size of the font (historically the width of the capital "M"). Setting the font size may, in turn, change the size of other items, since it is used to compute the value of the em and ex length units.
line-break	A										The line-break CSS property is used to specify how (or if) to break lines.
scroll-snap-type	A										The scroll-snap-type CSS property defines how strictly snap points are enforced on the scroll container in case there is one.
Syntax	A										The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations. The CSS syntax reflects this goal and its basic building blocks are:
color	A										The color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1.
<custom-ident>	A										The custom-ident CSS data value denotes an arbitrary user-defined string used as an identifier. It is case-sensitive and in each context, several values are excluded to prevent misinterpretations.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.
border-color	A										The border-color CSS property is a shorthand for setting the color of the four sides of an element's border: border-top-color, border-right-color, border-bottom-color, border-left-color
outline	A										The CSS outline property is a shorthand property for setting one or more of the individual outline properties outline-style, outline-width and outline-color in a single declaration. In most cases the use of this shortcut is preferable and more convenient.
padding-right	A										The padding-right CSS property of an element sets the padding space required on the right side of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Negative values are not allowed.
flex-direction	A										The flex-direction CSS property specifies how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).
flex-wrap	A										The CSS flex-wrap property specifies whether flex items are forced into a single line or can be wrapped onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, this property also enables you to control the direction in which lines are stacked.
grid-column-end	A										The grid-column-end CSS property specifies a grid item’s end position within the grid column by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the block-end edge of its grid area.
line-height	A										On block level elements, the line-height property specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.
text-decoration	A										The text-decoration CSS property is used to set the text formatting to underline, overline, line-through or blink. Underline and overline decorations are positioned under the text, line-through over it.
text-align	A										The text-align CSS property describes how inline content like text is aligned in its parent block element. text-align does not control the alignment of block elements, only their inline content.
<angle>	A										The angle CSS data type represents angle values. Positive angles represent clockwise angles, negative angles represent counterclockwise angles. Its syntax is a number data type immediately followed by the unit (deg, grad, rad or turn). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
top	A										The top CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements. It has no effect on non-positioned elements.
Pseudo-elements	A										Just like pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements are added to selectors but instead of describing a special state, they allow you to style certain parts of a document. For example, the ::first-line pseudo-element targets only  the first line of an element specified by the selector.
column-rule	A										In multi-column layouts, the column-rule CSS property specifies a straight line, or "rule", to be drawn between each column. It is a convenient shorthand to avoid setting each of the individual column-rule-* properties separately : column-rule-width, column-rule-style and column-rule-color.
:scope	A										The :scope CSS pseudo-class matches the elements that are a reference point for selectors to match against. In HTML, a new reference point can be defined using the scoped attribute of the style. If no such attribute is used on an HTML page, the reference point is the html element.
initial value	A										The initial value given in the summary of the definition of each CSS property has different meaning for inherited and non-inherited properties.
::backdrop	A										Each element in the top layer 's stack has a ::backdrop pseudo-element. This pseudo-element is a box rendered immediately below the element (and above the element below the element in the stack, if any), within the same top layer.
grid-area	A										The grid-area CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start and grid-column-end specifying a grid item’s size and location within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the edges of its grid area.
cursor	A										The cursor CSS property specifies the mouse cursor displayed when the mouse pointer is over an element.
border-inline-end-style	A										The border-inline-end-style CSS property defines the style of the logical inline end border of an element, which maps to a physical border style depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, or border-left-style property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
symbols()	A										The symbols() function allows counter styles to be defined inline, directly as the value of the CSS property. Unlike styles defines with @counter-style, these styles are anonymous. The symbols() function doesn't have all the capabilities and options of the @counter-style at-rule, but is useful in cases such as when the style is used only once and you don't need all the the options provided by @counter-style.
order	A										The CSS order property specifies the order used to lay out flex items in their flex container. Elements are laid out in the ascending order of the order value. Elements with the same order value are laid out in the order in which they appear in the source code.
visibility	A										The visibility property can be used to hide an element while leaving the space where it would have been. It can also hide rows or columns of a table.
filter	A										The filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.
border-bottom	A										The border-bottom CSS property is a shorthand that sets the values of border-bottom-color, border-bottom-style, and border-bottom-width. These properties describe the bottom border of elements.
background-clip	A										The background-clip CSS property specifies whether an element's background, either the color or image, extends underneath its border.
Universal selectors	A										An asterisk (*) is the universal selector for CSS. It matches a single element of any type. Omitting the asterisk with simple selectors has the same effect. For instance, *.warning and.warning are considered equal.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
unicode-bidi	A										The unicode-bidi CSS property together with the direction property relates to the handling of bidirectional text in a document. For example, if a block of text contains both left-to-right and right-to-left text then the user-agent uses a complex Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text. This property overrides this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding.
Using CSS multiple backgrounds	A										With CSS3, you can apply multiple backgrounds to elements. These are layered atop one another with the first background you provide on top and the last background listed in the back.
Using CSS flexible boxes	A										The CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox, is a layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
:optional	A										The :optional CSS pseudo-class represents any input element that does not have the required attribute set on it. This allows forms to easily indicate optional fields, and to style them accordingly.
background-attachment	A										If a background-image is specified, the background-attachment CSS property determines whether that image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls along with its containing block.
list-style-position	A										The list-style-position property specifies the position of the marker box in the principal block box.
perspective	A										The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give to the 3D-positioned element some perspective. Each 3D element with z0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property.
unicode-range	A										The unicode-range CSS descriptor sets the specific range of characters to be used from a font defined by @font-face and made available for use on the current page. If the page doesn't use any character in this range, the font is not downloaded; if it uses at least one, the whole font is downloaded.
<custom-ident>	A										The custom-ident CSS data value denotes an arbitrary user-defined string used as an identifier. It is case-sensitive and in each context, several values are excluded to prevent misinterpretations.
Resolved value	A										The resolved value of a CSS property is the value returned by getComputedStyle(). For most properties, it is the computed value, but for a few legacy properties (including width and height), it is instead the used value. See the specification link below for more per-property details.
ruby-position	A										The ruby-position CSS property defines the position of a ruby element relatives to its base element. It can be position over the element (over), under it (under), or between the characters, on their right side (inter-character).
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
Document.styleSheets	A										The Document.styleSheets read-only property returns a StyleSheetList of CSSStyleSheet objects for stylesheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document.
float	A										The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it.
word-break	A										The word-break CSS property is used to specify whether to break lines within words.
<image>	A										The image CSS data type represents a 2D image. There are two kinds of images in CSS: plain static images, often referenced using a URL, and dynamically-generated images like gradients or representations of parts of the tree.
mask-position	A										The mask-position CSS property sets the initial position, relative to the mask position layer defined by mask-origin for each defined mask image.
grid-column-gap	A										The grid-column-gap CSS property specifies the gutter between grid columns.
isolation	A										The isolation CSS property defines if the element must create a new stacking context.
font-synthesis	A										The font-synthesis CSS property controls which missing typefaces, bold or italic, may be synthesized by the browser.
outline-color	A										The outline-color CSS property sets the color of the outline of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge, to make the element stand out.
font-language-override	A										The font-language-override CSS property controls the usage of language-specific glyphs in a typeface.
margin-right	A										The margin-right CSS property of an element sets the margin space required on the right side of an element. A negative value is also allowed. The vertical margins of two adjacent boxes may fuse. This is called margin collapsing.
list-style	A										The list-style property is a shorthand property for setting list-style-type, list-style-image and list-style-position.
animation-name	A										The animation-name CSS property specifies a list of animations that should be applied to the selected element. Each name indicates a @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence.
mask	A										The mask property in CSS allows users to alter the visibility of an item by either partially or fully hiding it. This is accomplished by either masking or clipping the image at specific points.
flex-flow	A										The flex-flow CSS property is a shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap individual properties.
transform-style	A										The transform-style CSS property determines if the children of the element are positioned in the 3D-space or are flattened in the plane of the element.
max-block-size	A										The max-block-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical maximal size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the max-width or the max-height property, depending on the value defined for writing-mode. If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of max-block-size relates to the maximal width of the element, otherwise it relates to the maximal height of the element. It relates to max-inline-size, which defines the other dimension of the element.
border-block-start	A										The border-block-start CSS property is a shorthand property for setting the individual logical block start border property values in a single place in the style sheet. border-block-start can be used to set the values for one or more of: border-block-start-width, border-block-start-style, border-block-start-color. It maps to a physical border depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top, border-right, border-bottom, or border-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
image-orientation	A										The image-orientation CSS property describes how to correct the default orientation of an image.
<time>	A										The time CSS data type denotes time dimensions expressed in seconds or milliseconds. They consists of a​ ​​​​​​ number immediately followed by the unit. Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
break-before	A										The break-before CSS property describes how the page, column or region break behavior before the generated box. If there is no generated box, the property is ignored.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
animation-play-state	A										The animation-play-state CSS property determines whether an animation is running or paused. This can be queried to determine whether or not the animation is currently running. In addition, its value can be set to pause and resume playback of an animation.
:root	A										The :root CSS pseudo-class matches the root element of a tree representing the document. Applied to HTML, :root represents the html element and is identical to the selector html, except that its specificity is higher.
grid-row-gap	A										The grid-row-gap CSS property specifies the gutter between grid rows.
background-color	A										The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent.
display	A										The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline.
column-width	A										The column-width CSS property suggests an optimal column width. The column-width is the maximum width a column will become before adding another column. For instance, a 300px column width a gap of 0px would be a single column at 599px, but at 600px it would be split into 2 columns. This allows us to achieve scalable designs that fit different screen sizes. Especially in presence of the column-count CSS property which has precedence, to set an exact column width, all length values must be specified. In horizontal text these are width, column-width, column-gap, and column-rule-width.
table-layout	A										The table-layout CSS property defines the algorithm to be used to layout the table cells, rows, and columns.
animation-direction	A										The animation-direction CSS property indicates whether the animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
grid-auto-flow	A										The grid-auto-flow CSS property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works, specifying exactly how auto-placed items get flowed into the grid.
align-content	A										The CSS align-content property aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space on the cross-axis.
Descendant selectors	A										A descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space () character in the form of selector₁ selector₂ — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector (selector₂) are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector (selector₁). Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
border-inline-start	A										The border-inline-start CSS property is a shorthand property for setting the individual logical inline start border property values in a single place in the style sheet. border-inline-start can be used to set the values for one or more of: border-inline-start-width, border-inline-start-style, border-inline-start-color. It maps to a physical border depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top, border-right, border-bottom, or border-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
min-width	A										The min-width property is used to set the minimum width of a given element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width.
linear-gradient()	A										The CSS linear-gradient() function creates an image which represents a linear gradient of colors. The result of this function is an object of the CSS gradient data type. Like any other gradient, a CSS linear gradient is not a CSS color but an image with no intrinsic dimensions ; that is, it has neither natural or preferred size, nor ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.
column-count	A										The column-count CSS property describes the number of columns of the element.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
border-spacing	A										The border-spacing CSS property specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent table cells (only for the separated borders model). This is equivalent to the cellspacing attribute in presentational HTML, but an optional second value can be used to set different horizontal and vertical spacing.
min-inline-size	A										The min-inline-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical minimal size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the min-width or the min-height property, depending on the value defined for writing-mode. If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of min-inline-size relates to the minimal height of the element, otherwise it relates to the minimal width of the element. It relates to min-block-size, which defines the other dimension of the element.
<url>	A										The url CSS data type denotes a pointer to a resource. It has no proper syntax and can only be expressed through the url() functional notation.
CSSRuleList	A										A CSSRuleList is an (indirect-modify only) array-like object containing an ordered collection of CSSRule objects.
column-span	A										The column-span CSS property makes it possible for an element to span across all columns when its value is set to all. An element that spans more than one column is called a spanning element.
Specificity	A										Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of CSS selectors of different sorts.
border-right-color	A										The border-right-color CSS property sets the color of the right border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-right are more convenient and preferable.
Using CSS animations	A										CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another.
animation	A										The animation CSS property is a shorthand property for animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode and animation-play-state.
<resolution>	A										The resolution CSS data types, used in media queries, denotes the density of pixels of an output device, its resolution. It is a number immediately followed by a unit of resolution (dpi, dpcm,...). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
writing-mode	A										The writing-mode property defines whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically and the direction in which blocks progress.
grid-column-start	A										The grid-column-start CSS property specifies a grid item’s start position within the grid column by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the block-start edge of its grid area.
CSSStyleDeclaration.cssText	A										cssText returns or sets the text of the element's inline style declaration only. To be able to set a stylesheet rule dynamically, see Using dynamic styling information.
widows	A										When a paragraph is split over two pages in paged media, the widows CSS property defines the minimum number of lines that must be left at the top of the second page. In typography, a widow is the last line of a paragraph appearing alone at the top of a new page. Setting the widows property allows the prevention of single-line widows.
:link	A										The :link CSS pseudo-class lets you select links inside elements. This will select any link which has not yet been visited, even those already styled using selector with other link-related pseudo-classes like :hover, :active or :visited. In order to appropriately style links, you need to put the :link rule before the other ones, as defined by the LVHA-order : :link — :visited — :hover — :active. The :focus pseudo-class is usually placed right before or right after :hover, depending on the expected effect.
:only-child	A										The :only-child CSS pseudo-class represents any element which is the only child of its parent. This is the same as :first-child:last-child or :nth-child(1):nth-last-child(1), but with a lower specificity.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.
border-image-outset	A										The border-image-outset property describes by what amount the border image area extends beyond the border box.
white-space	A										The white-space property is used to describe how whitespace inside the element is handled.
font-size-adjust	A										The font-size-adjust CSS property specifies that font size should be chosen based on the height of lowercase letters rather than the height of capital letters. This is useful since the legibility of fonts, especially at small sizes, is determined more by the size of lowercase letters than by the size of capital letters.
flex-shrink	A										The flex-shrink CSS property specifies the flex shrink factor of a flex item.
initial	A										The initial CSS keyword applies the initial value of a property to an element. It is allowed on every CSS property and causes the element for which it is specified to use the initial value of the property.
@font-feature-values	A										The @font-feature-values CSS at-rule allows authors to use a common name in font-variant-alternates for feature activated differently in OpenType. It allows to simplify the CSS when using several fonts.
unset	A										The unset CSS keyword is the combination of the initial and inherit keywords. Like these two other CSS-wide keywords, it can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all. This keyword resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent or to its initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the inherit keyword in the first case and like the initial keyword in the second case.
position	A										The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects.
prefix	A										The prefix descriptor of the @counter-style rule allows authors to specify a symbol that will be prepended to the marker representation. If no value is specified, the default value will be the empty string.
inline-size	A										The inline-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the width or the height property depending on the value defined for writing-mode.
animation-fill-mode	A										The animation-fill-mode CSS property specifies how a CSS animation should apply styles to its target before and after it is executing.
Pseudo-classes	A										A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.
<percentage>	A										The percentage CSS data types represent a percentage value. Many CSS properties can take percentage values, often to define sizes in terms of parent objects. Percentages are formed by a number immediately followed by the percentage sign %. Just as is the case with all other units in CSS, there isn't a space between the '%' and the number.
list-style-image	A										The list-style-image property specifies an image to be used as the list item marker.
mix-blend-mode	A										The mix-blend-mode CSS property describes how an element's content should blend with the content of the element that is below it and the element's background.
Element.classList	A										The Element.classList is a read-only property which returns a live DOMTokenList collection of the class attributes of the element.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.
border-left-width	A										The border-left-width CSS property sets the width of the left border of a box.
CSSRule.cssText	A										cssText returns the actual text of a CSSStyleSheet style-rule.
padding-block-end	A										The padding-block-end CSS property defines the logical block end padding of an element, which maps to a physical padding depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, or padding-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
<basic-shape>	A										The basic-shape type can be specified using basic shape functions. When using this syntax to define shapes, the reference box is defined by each property that uses basic-shape values. The coordinate system for the shape has its origin on the top-left corner of the reference box with the x-axis running to the right and the y-axis running downwards. All the lengths expressed in percentages are resolved from the used dimensions of the reference box.
grid-gap	A										The grid-gap CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap specifying the gutters between grid rows and columns.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
:required	A										The :required CSS pseudo-class represents any input element that has the required attribute set on it. This allows forms to easily indicate which fields must have valid data before the form can be submitted.
filter	A										The filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.
border-block-start-width	A										The border-block-start-width CSS property defines the width of the logical block start border of an element, which maps to a physical border width depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width, or border-left-width property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
repeating-radial-gradient()	A										This works similarly to the standard radial gradients as described by radial-gradient(), but it automatically repeats the color stops infinitely in both directions, with their positions shifted by multiples of the difference between the last color stop's position and the first one's position.
columns	A										The columns CSS property is a shorthand property allowing to set both the column-width and the column-count properties at the same time.
margin-top	A										The margin-top CSS property of an element sets the margin space required on the top of an element. A negative value is also allowed. This property has no effect on non-replaced inline elements, like tt or span.
border-image-slice	A										The border-image-slice CSS property divides the image specified by border-image-source in nine regions: the four corners, the four edges and the middle. It does this by specifying 4 inwards offsets.
:nth-of-type	A										The :nth-of-type(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has a n+ b -1 siblings with the same element name before it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element. See :nth-child for a more thorough description of the syntax of its argument. This is a more flexible and useful pseudo selector if you want to ensure you're selecting the same type of tag no matter where it is inside the parent element, or what other different tags appear before it.
::placeholder	A										The ::placeholder CSS pseudo-element represents the placeholder text of a form element. This allows web developers and theme designers to customize the appearance of placeholder text.

<ratio>	A										The ratio CSS data type, used for describing aspect ratios in media queries, denotes the proportion between two unitless values. It is a strictly positive integer followed by a slash ('/', Unicode U+002F SOLIDUS) and a second strictly positive integer. There may be spaces before and after the solidus.
used value	A										The used value of any CSS property is the final value of that property after all calculations have been performed. For some properties, used values can be retrieved by calling window.getComputedStyle. Dimensions (e.g., width, line-height) are all in pixels, shorthand properties (e.g., background) are consistent with their component properties (e.g., background-color, display) and consistent with position and float, and every CSS property has a value.
tab-size	A										The tab-size CSS property is used to customize the width of a tab (U+0009) character.
font-variant-alternates	A										The font-variant-alternates CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs. These alternate glyphs may be referenced by alternative names defined in @font-feature-values.

border-block-end	A										The border-block-end CSS property is a shorthand property for setting the individual logical block end border property values in a single place in the style sheet. border-block-end can be used to set the values for one or more of: border-block-end-width, border-block-end-style, border-block-end-color. It maps to a physical border depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top, border-right, border-bottom, or border-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
:active	A										The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on a and button HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those.
transform-origin	A										The transform-origin property lets you modify the origin for transformations of an element. For example, the transform-origin of the rotate() function is the centre of rotation. (This property is applied by first translating the element by the negated value of the property, then applying the element's transform, then translating by the property value.)
overflow-y	A										The overflow-y property specifies whether to clip content, render a scroll bar, or display overflow content of a block-level element, when it overflows at the top and bottom edges.
specified value	A										The specified value of a CSS property is set in one out of three ways.
text-overflow	A										The text-overflow CSS property determines how overflowed content that is not displayed is signaled to users. It can be clipped, display an ellipsis (' … ', U+2026 Horizontal Ellipsis), or display a custom string.
counter-increment	A										The counter-increment CSS property is used to increase the value of CSS Counters by a given value. The counter's value can be reset using the counter-reset CSS property.
margin-left	A										The margin-left CSS property sets the margin space required on the left side of a box associated with an element. A negative value is also allowed. The vertical margins of two adjacent boxes may fuse. This is called margin collapsing. In the rare cases where width is overconstrained (that is when all of width, margin-left, border, padding, the content area and margin-right are defined), margin-left is ignored, and will have the same calculated value as if the auto value was specified.
height	A										The height CSS property specifies the height of the content area of an element. The content area is inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.
@supports	A										The @supports CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block, that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition consisting of testing of CSS declarations, that is property-value pairs, combined with arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of them. Such a condition is called a supports condition.
block-size	A										The block-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the width or the height property depending on the value defined for writing-mode.
grid	A										The grid CSS property is a shorthand property that sets all of the explicit grid properties (grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas), all the implicit grid properties (grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow), and the gutter properties (grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap) in a single declaration.

Replaced element	A										In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS. These are a type of external object whose representation is independent of the CSS. Typical replaced elements are img, object, video or form elements like textarea and input. Some elements, like audio or canvas are replaced elements only in specific cases. Objects inserted using the CSS content properties are anonymous replaced elements.
border-inline-start-width	A										The border-inline-start-width CSS property defines the width of the logical inline start border of an element, which maps to a physical border width depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width, or border-left-width property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
calc()	A										The calc() CSS function can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, number, or integer is required. With calc(), you can perform calculations to determine CSS property values.
background-position	A										The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each defined background image, relative to the background position layer defined by background-origin.
padding-bottom	A										The padding-bottom CSS property of an element sets the height of the padding area at the bottom of an element. The padding area is the space between the content of the element and its border. Contrary to margin-bottom values, negative values of padding-bottom are invalid.
outline-style	A										The outline-style CSS property is used to set the style of the outline of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge, to make the element stand out.

:empty	A										The :empty pseudo-class represents any element that has no children at all. Only element nodes and text (including whitespace) are considered. Comments or processing instructions do not affect whether an element is considered empty or not.
overflow-wrap	A										The overflow -wrap property is used to specify whether or not the browser may break lines within words in order to prevent overflow when an otherwise unbreakable string is too long to fit in its containing box.
max-height	A										The max-height CSS descriptor specifies the maximum height of the viewport of a document defined via the @viewport at-rule.
text-shadow	A										The text-shadow property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and text-decorations of the element.
element	A										The element() CSS function defines an image value generated from an arbitrary HTML element. This image is live, meaning that if the HTML element is changed, the CSS properties using the resulting value are automatically updated.
background-repeat	A										The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all.
margin-inline-start	A										The margin-inline-start CSS property defines the logical inline start margin of an element, which maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, or margin-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
width	A										The width CSS property specifies the width of the content area of an element. The content area is inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.
margin-bottom	A										The margin-bottom CSS property of an element sets the margin space required on the bottom of an element. A negative value is also allowed. This property has no effect on non-replaced inline elements, like tt or span.
border-image	A										The border-image CSS property allows drawing an image on the borders of elements. This makes drawing complex looking widgets much simpler than it has been and removes the need for nine boxes in some cases. The border-image is used instead of the border styles given by the border-style properties. Though the specification requires that border-style must be present if border-image is used, some browsers many not implement this.
offset-block-start	A										The offset-block-start CSS property defines the logical block start offset of an element, which maps to a physical offset depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the top, right, bottom, or left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.

counter-reset	A										The counter-reset CSS property is used to reset CSS Counters to a given value.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.
filter	A										The filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.
min-height	A										The min-height property is used to set the minimum height of a given element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.

<timing-function>	A										The timing-function CSS data type denotes a mathematical function that describes how fast one-dimensional values change during transitions or animations. This in essence lets you establish an acceleration curve, so that the speed of the animation can vary over its duration. These functions are often called easing functions.
text-emphasis	A										The text-emphasis CSS property is a shorthand property for setting text-emphasis-style and text-emphasis-color in one declaration. This property will apply the specified emphasis mark to each character of the element's text, except separator characters, like spaces,  and control characters.
:dir()	A										The :dir CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on the directionality of the text contained in it. In HTML, the direction is determined by the dir attribute. For other document types there may be other document methods for determining the language.
margin-block-end	A										The margin-block-end CSS property defines the logical block end margin of an element, which maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, or margin-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
grid-row	A										The grid-row CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-row-start and grid-row-end specifying a grid item’s size and location within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its grid area.
<frequency>	A										The frequency CSS data type denotes a frequency dimension, like the pitch of a speaking voice.
border-radius	A										The border-radius CSS property allows Web authors to define how rounded border corners are. The curve of each corner is defined using one or two radii, defining its shape: circle or ellipse.

justify-content	A										The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around flex items along the main-axis of their container.
@namespace	A										@namespace is an at-rule that defines XML namespaces to be used in a CSS style sheet. The defined namespaces can be used to restrict the universal, type, and attribute selectors to only select elements within that namespace. The @namespace rule is generally only useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces—such as HTML5 with inline SVG or MathML, or XML that mixes multiple vocabularies.
border-inline-end-width	A										The border-inline-end-width CSS property defines the width of the logical inline end border of an element, which maps to a physical border width depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width, or border-left-width property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.

:lang	A										The :lang CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on the language the element is determined to be in. In HTML, the language is determined by a combination of the lang attribute, the meta element, and possibly by information from the protocol (such as HTTP headers). For other document types there may be other document methods for determining the language.
Using CSS transforms	A										By modifying the coordinate space, CSS transforms change the shape and position of the affected content without disrupting the normal document flow. This guide provides an introduction to using transforms.
@font-face	A										The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.
border-inline-end	A										The border-inline-end CSS property is a shorthand property for setting the individual logical inline end border property values in a single place in the style sheet. border-inline-end can be used to set the values for one or more of: border-inline-end-width, border-inline-end-style, border-inline-end-color.

:disabled	A										The :disabled CSS pseudo-class represents any disabled element. An element is disabled if it can't be activated (e.g. selected, clicked on or accept text input) or accept focus. The element also has an enabled state, in which it can be activated or accept focus.
<gradient>	A										The gradient CSS data type denotes a CSS image made of a progressive transition between two or more colors. A CSS gradient is not a CSS color but an image with no intrinsic dimensions ; that is, it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the one of the element it applies to.
box-shadow	A										The box-shadow property describes one or more shadow effects as a comma-separated list.

It corresponds to the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, or padding-left property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
@charset	A										The @charset CSS at-rule specifies the character encoding used in the style sheet. It must be the first element in the style sheet and not be preceded by any character; as it is not a nested statement, it cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules. If several @charset at-rules are defined, only the first one is used, and it cannot be used inside a style attribute on an HTML element or inside the style element where the character set of the HTML page is relevant.
font-style	A										The font-style CSS property lets you select italic or oblique faces within a font-family. Italic forms are generally cursive in nature, usually using less horizontal space than their unstyled counterparts, while oblique faces are usually just sloped versions of the regular face. Both italic and oblique faces are simulated by artificially sloping the glyphs of the regular face (see font-synthesis for control over this).
mask-image	A										The mask-image CSS property sets the image that is used as mask layer for an element.
max-inline-size	A										The max-inline-size CSS property defines the horizontal or vertical maximal size of an element's block depending on its writing mode. It corresponds to the max-width or the max-height property depending on the value defined for writing-mode. If the writing mode is vertically oriented, the value of max-inline-size relates to the maximal height of the element, otherwise it relates to the maximal width of the element. It relates to max-block-size, which defines the other dimension of the element.
orientation	A										The orientation CSS descriptor controls the orientation of a document defined by @viewport.
transform	A										The CSS transform property lets you modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. Using it, elements can be translated, rotated, scaled, and skewed.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.

border-bottom-left-radius	A										The border-bottom-left-radius CSS property sets the rounding of the bottom-left corner of the element. The rounding can be a circle or an ellipse, or if one of the value is 0 no rounding is done and the corner is square.
grid-column	A										The grid-column CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-column-start and grid-column-end specifying a grid item’s size and location within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its grid area.
box-decoration-break	A										The box-decoration-break CSS property specifies how the background, padding, border, border-image, box-shadow, margin and clip of an element is applied when the box for the element is fragmented.  Fragmentation occurs when an inline box wraps onto multiple lines, or when a block spans more than one column inside a column layout container, or spans a page break when printed.  Each piece of the rendering for the element is called a fragment.
animation-iteration-count	A										The animation-iteration-count CSS property defines the number of times an animation cycle should be played before stopping.
repeating-linear-gradient()	A										The CSS repeating-linear-gradient function creates an image consisting of repeating gradients. It works similarly to the basic linear gradients as described by linear-gradient(), and takes the same arguments. However, it automatically repeats the color stops infinitely in both directions. The color stops' positions shift by multiples of the length of a basic linear gradient (the difference between the last color stops' position and the first).
<resolution>	A										The resolution CSS data types, used in media queries, denotes the density of pixels of an output device, its resolution. It is a number immediately followed by a unit of resolution (dpi, dpcm,...). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
text-orientation	A										The text-orientation CSS property defines the orientation of the text in a line. This property only has an effect in vertical mode, that is when writing-mode is not horizontal-tb. It is useful to control the display of writing in languages using vertical script, but also to deal with vertical table headers.
CSSStyleRule.selectorText	A										The CSSRule.selectorText property gets the textual representation of the selector for the rule set. This is implemented in a readonly manner; to set stylesheet rules dynamically, see Using dynamic styling information.
Mastering margin collapsing	A										Top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the margins combined into it, a behavior known as margin collapsing.
ruby-align	A										The ruby-align CSS property defines the distribution of the different ruby elements over the base.

border-image-width	A										The border-image-width CSS property defines the width of the border image by defining inward offsets from the border edges. If the border-image-width is greater than the border-width, then the border image extends beyond the padding (and/or content) edge.
Layout mode	A										A CSS layout mode, sometimes abbreviated as layout, is an algorithm determining the position and the size of boxes based on the way they interact with their sibling and ancestor boxes. There are several of them:
text-emphasis-color	A										The text-emphasis-color CSS property defines the color used to draw an emphasis mark. It can also be set, and reset, using the text-emphasis shorthand.
scroll-snap-destination	A										The scroll-snap-destination CSS property defines the position in x and y coordinates within the scroll container's visual viewport which element snap points align with.
Using CSS transitions	A										CSS transitions, provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.
:not()	A										The negation CSS pseudo-class, :not(X), is a functional notation taking a simple selector X as an argument. It matches an element that is not represented by the argument. X must not contain another negation selector.
transition-timing-function	A										The transition-timing-function CSS property is used to describe how the intermediate values of the CSS properties being affected by a transition effect are calculated. This in essence lets you establish an acceleration curve, so that the speed of the transition can vary over its duration.
clear	A										The clear CSS property specifies whether an element can be next to floating elements that precede it or must be moved down (cleared) below them. The clear property applies to both floating and non-floating elements.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
<shape>	A										The shape CSS data type denotes the specific form of a region. This region is used to define on which part of an element some properties like clip do apply.
mask-size	A										The mask-size CSS property specifies the sizes of the mask images. The size of the image can be fully or partially constrained in order to preserve its intrinsic ratio.
suffix	A										The suffix is used with @counter-style to specify a symbol that will be appended to the marker representation. A symbol can be a string, image or a CSS identifier. If not specified, the descriptor assumes the default value "\2E\20" ("." full stop followed by a space).
Selectors	A										This is the 5th section of the CSS Getting Started tutorial; it explains how you can apply styles selectively, and how different kinds of selectors have different priorities. You add some attributes to the tags in your sample document, and you use these attributes in your sample stylesheet.
font-variant-ligatures	A										The font-variant-ligatures CSS property controls which ligatures and contextual forms are used in textual content of the elements it applies to. This leads to more harmonized forms in the resulting text.
:fullscreen	A										The :fullscreen CSS pseudo-class applies to any element that's currently being displayed in full-screen mode. It selects not only to the top level element, but to the whole stack of elements that appears.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
break-after	A										The break-after CSS property describes the page, column, or region break behavior (in other words, how and whether to break) after the generated box. If there is no generated box, the property is ignored.
border-block-start-style	A										The border-block-start-style CSS property defines the style of the logical block start border of an element, which maps to a physical border style depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, or border-left-style property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
negative	A										When defining custom counter styles, the negative descriptor lets the author alter the representations of negative counter values, by providing a way to specify symbols to be appended or prepended to the counter representation when the value is negative.
<time>	A										The time CSS data type denotes time dimensions expressed in seconds or milliseconds. They consists of a​ ​​​​​​ number immediately followed by the unit. Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
<color>	A										The color CSS data type denotes a color in the sRGB color space. A color can be described in any of these ways:
background-size	A										The background-size CSS property specifies the size of the background images. The size of the image can be fully constrained or only partially in order to preserve its intrinsic ratio.
overflow	A										The overflow property specifies whether to clip content, render scrollbars or just display content when it overflows its block level container.
border-bottom-style	A										The border-bottom-style CSS property sets the line style of the bottom border of a box.
:first-of-type	A										The :first-of-type CSS pseudo-class represents the first sibling of its type in the list of children of its parent element.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
:nth-last-child	A										The :nth-last-child(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has a n+ b -1 siblings after it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element.
border-right-style	A										The border-right-style CSS property sets the line style of the right border of a box.
flex	A										The flex CSS property is a shorthand property specifying the ability of a flex item to alter its dimensions to fill available space. Flex items can be stretched to use available space proportional to their flex grow factor or their flex shrink factor to prevent overflow.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
font-stretch	A										The font-stretch property selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font. This property does not change the geometry of an arbitrary font by stretching or shrinking it. Like font-feature-settings or font-variant, it is merely a mean to choose the most appropriate face of the font, if this one offers several of them.
grid-template-areas	A										The grid-template-areas CSS property specifies named grid areas.
@keyframes	A										The @keyframes CSS at-rule lets authors control the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by establishing keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence that must be reached by certain points during the animation. This gives you more specific control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than you'd get when letting the browser handle everything automatically.
:read-write	A										The :read-write CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is editable by user like text input elements.
:checked	A										The :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (input type="radio"), checkbox (input type="checkbox") or option (option in a select) element that is checked or toggled to an on state. The user can change this state by clicking on the element, or selecting a different value, in which case the :checked pseudo-class no longer applies to this element, but will to the relevant one.
text-emphasis-position	A										The text-emphasis-position CSS property describes where emphasis marks are drawn at. The effect of emphasis marks on the line height is the same as for ruby text: if there isn't enough place, the line height is increased.
symbols	A										The symbols descriptor is used to specify the symbols that the specified counter system will use to construct counter representations. A symbol can be a string, image, or identifier.
font-variant-position	A										The font-variant-position CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs of smaller size positioned as superscript or subscript regarding the baseline of the font, which is set unchanged. These glyphs are likely to be used in sub and sup elements.
speak-as	A										The speak-as descriptor specifies how a counter symbol constructed with a given @counter-style will be represented in the spoken form. For example, an author can specify a counter symbol to be either spoken as its numerical value or just represent it with an audio cue.
all	A										The CSS all shorthand property resets all properties, apart from unicode-bidi and direction, to their initial or inherited value.
border-top-left-radius	A										The border-top-left-radius CSS property sets the rounding of the top-left corner of the element. The rounding can be a circle or an ellipse, or if one of the value is 0, no rounding is done and the corner is square.
:focus	A										The :focus CSS pseudo-class is applied when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input).
border-block-start-color	A										The border-block-start-color CSS property defines the color of the logical block start border of an element, which maps to a physical border color depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation. It corresponds to the border-top-color, border-right-color, border-bottom-color, or border-left-color property depending on the values defined for writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
<angle>	A										The angle CSS data type represents angle values. Positive angles represent clockwise angles, negative angles represent counterclockwise angles. Its syntax is a number data type immediately followed by the unit (deg, grad, rad or turn). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.
touch-action	A										The touch-action CSS property specifies whether, and in what ways, a given region can be manipulated by the user (for instance, by panning or zooming).
var()	A										The var() function can be used instead of any part of a value in any property on an element. The var() function can not be used as property names, selectors or anything else besides property values. (Doing so usually produces invalid syntax or else a value whose meaning has no connection to the variable.)
margin	A										The margin CSS property sets the margin for all four sides. It is a shorthand to avoid setting each side separately with the other margin properties: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left.
At-rule	A										An at-rule is a CSS statement beginning with an at sign, ' @ ' (U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT), followed by an identifier and includes everything up to the next semi-colon, ' ; ' (U+003B SEMICOLON), or the next CSS block, whichever comes first.
border-left	A										The border-left CSS property is a shorthand that sets the values of border-left-color, border-left-style, and border-left-width. These properties describe the left border of elements.
<length>	A										The length CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is optional after the number 0.
transition-duration	A										The transition-duration CSS property specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur.
will-change	A										The will-change CSS property provides a way for authors to hint browsers about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is actually changed.
additive-symbols	A										The additive-symbols descriptor is similar to the symbols descriptor and allows the user to specify symbols to be used for counter representations when the value of the system descriptor is additive. The additive-symbols descriptor defines what are known as additive tuples, each of which is a pair containing a symbol and a non-negative integer weight.
empty-cells	A										The empty-cells CSS property specifies how user agents should render borders and backgrounds around cells that have no visible content.
left	A										The left CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements.
<transform-function>	A										The transform-function CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.
opacity	A										The opacity CSS property specifies the transparency of an element, that is, the degree to which the background behind the element is overlaid.
backface-visibility	A										The CSS backface-visibility property determines whether or not the back face of the element is visible when facing the user. The back face of an element is always a transparent background, letting, when visible, a mirror image of the front face be displayed.
:valid	A										The :valid CSS pseudo-class represents any input or form element whose content validates correctly according to the input's type setting. This allows to easily make valid fields adopt an appearance that helps the user confirm that their data is formatted properly.
font-family	A										The font-family CSS descriptor allows authors to specify the font for an element.
font-variant-alternates	A										The font-variant-alternates CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs. These alternate glyphs may be referenced by alternative names defined in @font-feature-values.
font-variant-numeric	A										The font-variant-numeric CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs for numbers, fractions, and ordinal markers.
@media	A										The @media CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition defined by a media query. The @media at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.
text-indent	A										The text-indent property specifies the amount of indentation (empty space) should be left before lines of text in a block. By default, this controls the indentation of only the first formatted line of the block, but the hanging and each-line keywords can be used to change this behavior.
